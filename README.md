# FacilityMaintenanceSystem-EMKAN

Facility Maintenance System is a system that works as a communication channel between a business and its customers and employees. The goal is to resolve customers' issues regarding facility maintence by the business.
The system is designed using 3-tiers architecture with three physical layers: Presentation layer, Business layer, and WebAPI and DataAccess layer. In addition, it includes logs for each exception, so it is easier to debug problems then fix them. Moreover, it includes JWT authentication and authorization. It also includes many other features like HealthCheck, audit trail, ping for interfaces and API layer, and so on. Also, we need to publish the project, upload it to server and test it. However, there are five main users for the system: System Administrator, Building Manager, Maintenance Manager, Maintenance worker, and Client.
